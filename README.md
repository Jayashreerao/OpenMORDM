# OpenMORDM #

OpenMORDM is an open-source R library for Multiobjective Robust Decision Making (MORDM).
It includes support for loading datasets from a number of sources including
CSV, XLS, XLSX, optimization output files (from [Borg](http://www.borgmoea.org/)
or the [MOEA Framework](http://www.moeaframework.org/)), and R matrices and data frames;
visualizing the data sets using various 2D and 3D plots; performing scenario
discovery and tradeoff analysis; and computing uncertainty/robustness metrics.
OpenMORDM also includes a web-based data exploration and visualization toolkit
that can be launched through the `runVisDemo` or `explore` commands.
