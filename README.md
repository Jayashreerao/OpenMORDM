OpenMORDM is an open-source R library for Multiobjective Robust Decision Making (MORDM).
OpenMORDM's core features include:

1. Connecting to models written in R or compiled as executables;
2. Defining uncertain and deeply uncertain model inputs;
3. Evaluating the model across many hypothetical states of the world (SOWs);
4. Identifying potential robust designs using customizable robustness criteria;
5. Characterizing vulnerabilities of designs using PRIM or CART;
6. Evaluating tradeoffs among designs using various visualization tools; and
7. An interactive, web-based visualization toolkit for sharing results [(live demo)](https://openmordm.shinyapps.io/Iris)

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/dhadka/OpenMORDM/wiki) for installation instructions, tutorials, and more.
