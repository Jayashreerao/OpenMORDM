}
\arguments{
\item{problem}{the problem setup}

\item{NFE}{the maximum number of function evaluations}

\item{executable}{the path the the optimization executable}

\item{output}{the location where the runtime output is stored}

\item{output.frequency}{the frequency at which data is output}

\description{
Optimizes the problem.  By default, this method uses the Borg MOEA, which
must first be compiled into an executable on your system.  Since the Borg
MOEA targets POSIX systems, this method is typically not available on
Windows unless you are running inside Cygwin.
